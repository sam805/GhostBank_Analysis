# GhostBank_Analysis
When a well-known URL for any reason, is no longer associated with the original owner or business, it
becomes a tool to manipulate and monetize unaware users. This idea of “reputation hijacking” pose a great
threat to security of internet today since there are not enough effective policies regarding this issue. The
specific case that motivated the original authors was banking URLs, which is also the basis for our project
here. We updated some of the results of the original paper with a new batch of official data and came up
with some results confirming the findings of the original publication. The most surprising results we found,
compared to the original paper, include domains being hijacked more quickly and the resurrection of more
bank held domains. We deduced that although the rate of closed banks in recent years were low, there are
still many obsolete bank URLs that are being misused to trick the unsuspecting users. The results of the
paper and our project should provide motivation for future research and attract more attention to the
necessity of implementing appropriate policies regarding this issue.
